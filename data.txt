My School Sucks.
School is the worst place on earth. I mean, its not like Im some kind of loser who cannot handle the pressure or anything. Im just a normal teenager who is trying to get through life without having to deal with all the BS that goes on at school.
First of all, the teachers are all a bunch of power-hungry jerks. They think they are the only ones who know anything, and they are always trying to control us. They pile on homework and give us these stupid tests that don't even matter in the real world.
And then there are the kids. Some of them are cool, but most of them are just a bunch of jerks. They are always talking crap about each other and trying to one-up each other. Its like they are all in some kind of competition to be the coolest kid in school.
The only thing I like about school is lunch. I mean, it's not like the food is great or anything, but it's at least a chance to get away from the teachers and the other kids for a few minutes. It still sucks.
But then its back to the same old crap. More homework, more tests, and more jerks. It's enough to make you want to tear your hair out.
I dont know why I even go to school anymore. Its not like I am learning anything important. I'm just wasting my time. I'd much rather be at home, playing video games or hanging out with my friends.
But no, I have to go to school and learn about a bunch of stuff that I will never use in the real world. Its so freaking stupid.
I wish there was some way to get out of going to school. But there isn't. So I guess I'm just going to have to suck it up and deal with it for a few more years.
Ugh. I hate school. It sucks.
