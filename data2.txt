Summer is the best season because I have a lot of free time. The best days are those when I play with my friends in the park. We run, play basketball, play football, or just talk. Then we can go swimming in the lake or go to the beach. When we get home, we are always very tired, but we are happy.
One of my best summer experiences was when my friends and I went to Lake Balaton. We were there for a week and had a great time. We swam, sunbathed, and walked along the beach. My water gun worked perfectly. One day we even went on a boat trip. It was very exciting, and we saw many interesting things.
Summer is always full of experiences, and I love this season very much.
